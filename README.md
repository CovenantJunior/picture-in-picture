# picture-in-picture

Picture-in-picture (PiP) is a feature in modern televisions, computers, and mobile devices that allows a video or image to be displayed in a small window overlaid on top of another application or video that is already running on the screen. This means you can continue to watch a video while doing other tasks or activities, such as browsing the web, checking emails, or using other applications.

The PiP feature is commonly used for video conferencing, where you can have a video call window displayed in a corner of your screen while you work on other tasks. It is also used for watching sports events or TV shows, where you can keep an eye on the game or show while you work on other things. PiP is a convenient and practical feature that allows you to multitask while still keeping an eye on your favorite video content.
